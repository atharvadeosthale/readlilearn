title: Setting up our environment
---

Now that you are in the course, first of all welcome. In this chapter, we will be setting up our environment.

Use any of the following code editors:

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
- [Atom](https://atom.io/)

Here's a sample HTML code for you to understand:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My html page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>hello world!</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

**Remember**, HTML is NOT a programming language but a markup language
